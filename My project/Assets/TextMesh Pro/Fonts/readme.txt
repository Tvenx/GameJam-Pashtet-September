Voxel is a display typeface rooted from a linear grid-system, inspired by the old computers fonts in the 80s. Consistency is key when it comes to type design, this typeface uses grids as the foundation. However, Voxel has a special characteristic which is the smoothened edges to add the futuristic and modern element. Free to use!
